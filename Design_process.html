      <h1 id = "Title2"> The Beginning </h1>
      <p id = "info2"> We didn't start with an idea based around Mental health at first. We started an idea based around unemployment. We wanted to find a way for those unemployed to work and earn money so, they can provide for their family and pay their bills. However, we scrapped that idea because we couldn't think of a consistent and efficent way to help. We did more brainstorming and eventually settled upon mental health!

    <div class ='Mid'>
      <h1 id = "Title2">The Middle</h1>
      <p id = "info2"> We started off with how our App would function and look. We drew multiple sketches of our home screen and other. We thought of having multiple servers based on interest. For example having servers based on football or cooking. Having a search bar for communities user would like to join. We even have a sketch of a table talk. It's where the user would join and there would be a table for everyone to sit at and talk. There was also an idea based on the user's mood. The user would pick a mood they are feeling and based on their mood and intrest servers would be recommened to them or they can manually search up servers to go to.<br>
      <B>  Here are some sketches:</B></p>

    <h1 id = "Title2">The End</h1>
    <p id = "info2">The Final stretch! With the time slowly creeping up on us we kick it into overdrive. We worked on the prototype as much as we could and touched up our presentation as much as we could. Everyone even stayed up late to finish and make finishing touches on the presentation, website, and prototypes.  This is our vision for Encourage and we hope we can continue working together!</p>
